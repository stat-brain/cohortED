\title{Report Summary of Enrollment Trends by Grade and Year}
\usage{
report_students_by_grade_year(
  summary_output,
  pct_change_threshold = 10,
  grade_transition_threshold = 20,
  zscore_threshold = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary_output}{A list output from \code{summarize_students_by_grade_year()} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Summary_Long}: data frame with detailed enrollment counts by grade and year,
\item \code{Total_Enrollment}: data frame with total enrollment counts per year,
\item \code{Grade_Statistics}: data frame with enrollment means and SDs per grade.
}}

\item{pct_change_threshold}{Numeric scalar (default 10). Minimum percent change in total enrollment
from the previous year considered noteworthy for summary.}

\item{grade_transition_threshold}{Numeric scalar (default 20). Threshold percent change in grade-to-grade
enrollment used to flag notable shifts and highlight grades with largest increases or decreases.}

\item{zscore_threshold}{Numeric scalar (default 2). Z-score threshold for detecting unusual enrollment
counts (outliers) within grades over years.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{Paragraph_Summary}}{A concise executive-style summary paragraph highlighting
overall enrollment patterns and notable trends in simple language (no numbers).}
\item{\code{Paragraph_Detailed}}{A detailed paragraph describing recent enrollment,
grade-level changes, outliers, and variability with specific figures.}
\item{\code{Enrollment_Trends}}{Sentence describing total enrollment in the most recent year and change from prior year.}
\item{\code{Grade_Level_Changes}}{Sentence summarizing average and largest grade-to-grade enrollment changes.}
\item{\code{Outlier_Summary}}{Summary of detected unusual enrollment levels by grade and year, if any.}
\item{\code{Note}}{Suggested plot or table to review next based on findings (e.g., line plot, heatmap).}
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes enrollment summary data to produce clear, narrative
paragraphs describing overall enrollment trends, grade-level changes, and
unusual patterns over time. It highlights key shifts, extreme years, and
grade-to-grade enrollment transitions in plain language, suitable for
reports or presentations to school boards and state agencies.
}
\details{
This function assists with interpreting enrollment data by automatically
generating textual summaries based on numeric thresholds. It identifies:
\itemize{
\item Whether total enrollment has changed substantially recently.
\item If the most recent year is an extreme (highest or lowest) enrollment year.
\item Average and largest grade-to-grade changes in enrollment counts.
\item Grades with consistently high enrollment relative to the overall mean.
\item Grades and years with unusually high or low enrollment detected by z-score.
\item Whether changes are generally consistent across grades or if some grades
show more pronounced shifts.
}
It produces a brief, easy-to-understand summary paragraph for general audiences
and a more detailed paragraph with specific numeric insights for technical readers.

The \code{Note} element recommends which visualizations or tables to review next,
such as line plots, bar plots, or heatmaps, to facilitate data exploration.
