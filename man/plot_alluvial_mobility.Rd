\title{Plot Alluvial Mobility}
\usage{
plot_alluvial_mobility(dataset, current_year, current_grade, print_plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame that includes student grade level, academic year, gender, and ethnicity.}

\item{current_year}{The academic year to evaluate (e.g., "2020_2021").}

\item{current_grade}{The grade level to evaluate (e.g., 4 or "4").}

\item{print_plot}{Logical; if TRUE (default), the alluvial plot is printed.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{Data}{The updated dataset used for plotting}
\item{Data_Table}{A contingency table of Mobility x Gender x Ethnicity}
\item{Table_by_Ethnicity}{Proportion table by ethnicity}
\item{Table_by_Gender}{Proportion table by gender}
\item{Caption}{Text summary of transition between grades}
\item{Plot}{The generated ggplot2 object}
}
}
\description{
Creates an alluvial diagram that illustrates student mobility between years, segmented by gender and ethnicity. If \code{MOBILITY_STATUS} is not already present in the dataset, it will be computed using the provided grade and year.
