\usage{
analyze_student_cohorts(dataset, details = FALSE, extra_variables = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data.frame with at least \code{id}, \code{grade}, and \code{year}.}

\item{details}{Logical; if TRUE, returns additional internal components like the cleaned trajectory data and nested cohort list.}
