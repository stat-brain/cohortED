\title{Make First Entered}
\usage{
make_first_entered(dataset, print_plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing student-level longitudinal data.
Must include columns representing student IDs, grades, and academic years.}

\item{print_plot}{Logical (default: \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, the function will print both plots to the active graphics device.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{Data}}{The input dataset with a new column \code{FIRST_ENTERED}, indicating each student's first observed grade and year (e.g., \code{"1.2019"}).}
\item{\code{Table}}{A contingency table of first-time student counts by grade and year, with total row and column margins.}
\item{\code{Caption}}{A string caption describing the contingency table.}
\item{\code{Plot_by_Grade}}{A \code{ggplot2} line plot showing number of first-time students by grade and cohort (cohort defined as \code{year - grade}).}
\item{\code{Plot_by_Year}}{A \code{ggplot2} line plot showing first-time student counts by academic year and grade level.}
}

\description{
Identify First Grade-Year Entry per Student and Visualize Entry Patterns
}
\details{
This function identifies the first grade-year entry per student in a longitudinal dataset,
appends a \code{"FIRST_ENTERED"} column, produces a contingency table of first entries by grade and year,
and optionally generates two line plots of entry patterns across grades and years.

The function standardizes grade values by converting \code{"K"} to \code{0}, and \code{"PK"} or \code{"PreK"} to \code{-1} (case-insensitive),
allowing them to be plotted numerically. A totals row and column are added to the contingency table.

The function assumes the year is in a string format such as \code{"2019-20"} or \code{"2019"}, and extracts the numeric start year
using the first four characters. Grades are coerced to character for processing, and then converted to numeric for plotting
by interpreting \code{"K"} as \code{0} and \code{"PK"}/\code{"PreK"} as \code{-1}. Any other non-numeric grades will result in \code{NA} unless handled separately.
