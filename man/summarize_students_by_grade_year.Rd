\title{Summarize Enrollment by Grade and Year}
\usage{
summarize_students_by_grade_year(
  dataset,
  id_variables = list(student_id = "ID", grade = "GRADE", year = "YEAR")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing at least student ID, grade, and year columns.}

\item{id_variables}{A named list specifying the column names to use for:
\itemize{
\item \code{student_id}: unique student identifier (default "ID")
\item \code{grade}: student grade level (default "GRADE")
\item \code{year}: academic year (default "YEAR")
}}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Standard_Data}: standardized dataset with renamed columns and numeric grade
\item \strong{Summary_Long}: long-format table of student counts by grade and year
\item \strong{Summary_Wide}: wide-format table with academic years as columns
\item \strong{Grade_Statistics}: summary statistics (mean, SD, median, min, max) by grade
\item \strong{Total_Enrollment}: total student enrollment per year
\item \strong{Heatmap}: ggplot heatmap of student counts
\item \strong{Enrollment_LinePlot}: ggplot line plot of enrollment trends by grade
\item \strong{Enrollment_BarPlot}: ggplot stacked bar chart of grade enrollment per year
}
}
\description{
This function generates tables, summary statistics, and visualizations of student enrollment patterns
by grade level and academic year. It supports flexible column names and provides outputs in both
long and wide formats, along with heatmaps, line plots, and stacked bar charts for reporting purposes.
}
\details{
Grade levels are normalized to numeric values using the internal helper
\code{.normalize_grade()} for correct ordering. Year values are parsed using \code{.parse_year()}
and converted to academic year labels (e.g., "2022-2023") for use in tables and plots.

This function is designed for use in automated reporting workflows (e.g., Quarto)
and provides modular outputs for integration into templated documents.
