\usage{
make_achievement_levels(
  dataset,
  score,
  cuts,
  achievement_labels = NULL,
  print_plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A data frame containing the score variable.}

\item{score}{A string specifying the name of the numeric score variable
in the dataset to be categorized.}

\item{cuts}{A numeric vector of cutoff points that includes the minimum and
maximum possible scores as endpoints. Must be sorted or will be sorted
internally. The length of \code{cuts} should be one more than the desired
number of achievement levels.}

\item{achievement_labels}{An optional character or factor vector specifying
labels for the achievement levels in increasing order. If \code{NULL},
numeric labels (1, 2, ...) will be used. The length must match the number
of intervals defined by \code{cuts}.}

\item{print_plot}{Logical (default: \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, a bar plot showing the distribution
of achievement levels will be printed.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{Data}{Original dataset with a new column \code{ACHIEVEMENT_LEVELS} that is
an ordered factor representing achievement categories.}
\item{Table}{A table of percentage distribution of achievement levels.}
\item{Caption}{A descriptive caption of the achievement level distribution.}
\item{Barplot}{A \code{ggplot2} barplot object of the achievement level distribution.}
}
}

Create Ordered Achievement Levels Based on Score Cutoffs
}
\details{
This function categorizes numeric scores into ordered achievement levels
based on specified cutoff points. The achievement levels are returned as
an ordered factor to preserve their natural ranking.

The function uses \code{cut()} to categorize scores into ordered achievement
levels. It explicitly converts the result to an ordered factor to preserve
the ranking of levels, which is important for downstream analyses or plotting
where order matters.

The cutoff points (\code{cuts}) must cover the full score range, including
minimum and maximum values. Labels should be provided in increasing order
to correctly represent achievement progression.
