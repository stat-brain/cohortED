## Install cohortED from GitHub

The `cohortED` package is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/stat-brain/cohortED) and can be installed using the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) package.

First, install `devtools` if you havenâ€™t already:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install `cohortED` with
```r
devtools::install_github("stat-brain/cohortED")
```
### Load the package

After installation, load `cohortED` like any other R package:

```r
library(cohortED)
```

### Test your installation

You can verify that it's working by browsing package help:

```r
help(package = "cohortED")
```

Or try a basic function:

```r
