# packageSkeleton

## Introduction to packageSkeleton

- **packageSkeleton** is a streamlined GitHub template designed to simplify R package development.
- It also integrates with a Quarto-powered website hosted on GitHub, providing users a structured way to develop, document, and distribute their work.

---

## Why packageSkeleton?

- Encourages best practices in R package development
- Provides a structure that integrates R code and documentation
- Simplifies setting up a website for sharing your work
- Ideal for both beginners and experienced developers

---

## Key Features

- **R Package Template**: A basic structure that you can easily customize for your package needs.
- **GitHub Integration**: Fork the repository and start developing right away.
- **Quarto Documentation**: Create rich, dynamic content that documents your package and provides a public-facing website.

---

## Customizing packageSkeleton

1. **Rename the Package**: Start by modifying the `DESCRIPTION` file and renaming the package.
2. **Add Your Own Functions**: Inside the `R/` directory, include your custom R functions.
3. **Generate Documentation**: Use `roxygen2` to create function documentation and `Quarto` to build your website.
4. **Deploy the Website**: Publish the Quarto website using GitHub Pages.

---

## Requirements

- **R**: The latest version of R (available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- **Quarto**: The Quarto CLI tool for building documents and websites ([Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)).
- **Git**: Version control to manage your code and push to GitHub.
- **GitHub**: Host your R package and website.

---

## GitHub Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `packageSkeleton` repo from GitHub.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone the repo to your local machine using Git.
3. **Push Changes**: After making your edits, push them to your GitHub repository.
4. **Deploy Website**: Use GitHub Pages to host the Quarto-based documentation.

---

## Customizing the Website

- **Quarto Configuration**: Customize the `_quarto.yml` file to change the website settings such as title, author, and repository URL.
- **Add Pages**: Create `.qmd` files to add custom documentation, tutorials, and more.
- **Themes & Layouts**: Modify the website’s theme using CSS or choose from Quarto’s built-in themes.

---

## Building Your Package

- **Add Functions**: Use the `R/` folder to store your custom R scripts and functions.
- **Generate Documentation**: Write roxygen-style documentation for each function and build it using `devtools::document()`.
- **Check Your Package**: Ensure your package passes all R CMD checks by running `devtools::check()`.

---

## Publishing the Website

1. **Build the Website**: Run `quarto render` to build the static HTML content.
2. **Publish on GitHub Pages**: Push your changes to the repository and GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the site.
3. **Preview Locally**: Use `quarto preview` to see live updates of the website as you edit.

---

## Conclusion

- **packageSkeleton** is a powerful starting point for R package development.
- Use it to streamline your workflow, create well-documented R code, and publish it with a professional Quarto-powered website.
- Leverage GitHub for collaboration, version control, and public distribution of your work.
