# Agile Development to Support State Assessment Analyses
## Intern Update #1
**Brian Harrold and Erik Whitfield**  
June 20, 2025

:::


# Project Overview

**Brian Harrold and Erik Whitfield**

## Description

Create a suite of R packages to:

1. Support policy-relevant analysis of state educational data  
2. Develop reproducible R functions for common analytic tasks  
3. Use an iterative development process to build, test, and refine tools  
4. Empower state analysts and researchers to produce high-quality, replicable reports  

## Goal

Develop robust functionality to:

- Facilitate routine analysis  
- Streamline standard analytic workflows  
- Enable deeper, exploratory data investigations  
- Generate clear, reproducible reports and presentations  
- Provide comprehensive supporting documentation  

## Workflow

- **R and RStudio** – Programming and package development  
- **GitHub** – Version control and website hosting  
- **Quarto** – Website creation and dynamic report generation  


# cohortED package

**Brian Harrold**

## Focus of the Package

* Cohort Analysis for Educational Research
  + Demographics
  + Student Mobility
  + Longitudinal Analysis (tracking cohorts over time)
  + Cross-Sectional Analysis (comparing cohorts)

## Related Work

* `cohorts` package - Customer Analytics
* `survival` package - Time-to-Event Analytics
* `SGP` package - Student Growth Percentiles
* `brolgar` package - Longitudinal Data Analysis

## Vocabulary

* [Classifications:]{.underline} Leave, Join, Stay
* [From Cohort Analysis:]{.underline} Churn, Persistence

## Ideal Dataset

* Longitudinal Student-Level Data
  + **Example:** sgpData_Long from SGPdata package
  + **Requires:** Student ID, Grade Level, Academic Year
  + **Optional** Demographics, Subgroups, Performance, School/District, etc.

## Enabling the Ideal

* Helper Functions
  + `make_achievement_levels()`
  + `make_proficiency_levels()`
  + `make_mobility()`
  + `make_first_entered()`
  + `standardize_grade()`

## Example Output







## Visualizing

* Plotting Functions
  + plot_distribution_mobility()
  + plot_alluvial_mobility()
  + plot_cohort2_proficiency()
  
## Example Output






## Analyzing

* Analysis Functions
  + 
  + More to come...

## Example Report





## Persistent Challenges

* Designing flexible function arguments
* Creating cohesive, user-friendly functionality
* Handling data limitations
* Developing dynamic reporting capabilities

## Next Steps

* Build in more functionality and analysis features
* Expand dynamic reporting capabilities
* Test with additional datasets (as available)
* Obtain feedback

## Desired Feedback

- **Functionality:** Are there any features you think would be useful to add?  
- **Reporting:** Are there any challenges from states that this package could better support?  
- **Datasets:** Do you know of any datasets that can be used to test and validate the package?
