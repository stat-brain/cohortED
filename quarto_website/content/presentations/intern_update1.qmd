# Agile Development to Support State Assessment Analyses
## Intern Update #1
**Brian Harrold and Erik Whitfield**  
June 20, 2025

:::


# Project Overview

**Brian Harrold and Erik Whitfield**

## Description

Create a suite of R packages to:

1. Support policy-relevant analysis of state educational data  
2. Develop reproducible R functions for common analytic tasks  
3. Use an iterative development process to build, test, and refine tools  
4. Empower state analysts and researchers to produce high-quality, replicable reports  

## Goal

Develop robust functionality to:

- Facilitate routine analysis  
- Streamline standard analytic workflows  
- Enable deeper, exploratory data investigations  
- Generate clear, reproducible reports and presentations  
- Provide comprehensive supporting documentation  

## Workflow

- **R and RStudio** – Programming and package development  
- **GitHub** – Version control and website hosting  
- **Quarto** – Website creation and dynamic report generation

## Focus of the Package

* Cohort Analysis for Educational Research
  + Demographics
  + Student Mobility
  + Longitudinal Analysis (tracking cohorts over time)
  + Cross-Sectional Analysis (comparing cohorts)

## Why `cohortED`?

- How do students move between grade levels over time?
- Who is present in one year but not the next?
- When and where do enrollment patterns shift?
- How do these trends vary across districts or subgroups?
- How does student mobility impact metrics, such as performance or graduation rates?
- How do different cohorts compare to each other over time?

## Grade-to-Grade Transitions

Grouping students based on movement across adjacent grades:

- **Leave** - in the earlier grade but not the next  
- **Stay** - in both grades  
- **Join** - in the later grade but not the previous  

To support measures of:

- **Persistence** - proportion of students who stay  
- **Churn** - combined rate of students who leave or join  

## Looking for Your Insights

Please consider:

- What additional features or capabilities would be valuable?
- Are there any specific challenges or questions that states want addressed?
- Are there datasets that could help improve and validate the package?

## Ideal Dataset

* Longitudinal Student-Level Data
  + **Example:** `sgpData_Long` from `SGPdata` package
  + **Requires:** Student ID, Grade Level, Academic Year
  + **Optional** Demographics, Subgroups, Performance, School/District, etc.
  
## Current Analysis  

- Data Manipulation and Cohort Construction
- Grade-to-Grade Transition Tracking
- Cohort Demographic Comparisons
- Cross-Cohort Performance Summaries
- Analysis of Mobility's Impact on Performance

## Future Analysis

- Cross-District and Cross-School Mobility
- Advanced Subgroup Analysis
- Expanded Longitudinal Cohort Tracking
- Improved Visualization of Churn and Persistence

## Report Generation

**Currently**, reports are user-built with Modular Functions that have list output

* Updated or refined datasets
* Formatted table objects and summary statistics
* `ggplot2` plots
* Auto-generated captions
* Designed to be embedded in R Markdown or Quarto
  
**Future** versions will offer pre-built templates with dynamic text and visual explanations.

## Example Report

<iframe src="assets/mobility_report.html" width="100%" height="650px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

<div style="margin-top: 12px; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://stat-brain.github.io/cohortED/example_reports.html" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #007acc;">
    View Example Reports
  </a>
</div>

## Persistent Challenges

* Designing flexible function arguments
* Creating cohesive, user-friendly functionality
* Handling data limitations
* Developing dynamic reporting capabilities

## Next Steps

* Build in more functionality and analysis features
* Expand dynamic reporting capabilities
* Test with additional datasets (as available)
* Obtain feedback

## Desired Feedback

- **Functionality:** Are there any features you think would be useful to add?  
- **Reporting:** Are there any challenges from states that this package could better support?  
- **Datasets:** Do you know of any datasets that can be used to test and validate the package?
